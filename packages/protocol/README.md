# Protocol contracts

This package will contain versioned, implementation-neutral contracts for:

- audio-node registration, capability, health, and configuration;
- intended/observed state reconciliation;
- normalized receiver and audio telemetry;
- durable events and meter deltas;
- monitor-bus control and media authorization;
- show import/export manifests; and
- people/roles, performance cast and microphone assignment transactions;
- cue runtime, image relationships, incident ownership, and audit events; and
- backend/frontend API types.

The serialization format is not yet selected. Contracts must define units,
time domains, optional/unknown behavior, compatibility, bounds, and idempotency
before code generation is introduced.

The proposed semantics, including negotiation, snapshots/deltas, command
idempotency, atomic single-node activation, event delivery, imports, and Live
leases, are in [protocol v0](specification.md).
